* intro
  PARSING-ASM - a minimal syntax that parses atomic tokens (from scanner) and creates an output string
  creates a Lisp file that can parse pasm atomic syntax
  parser.lisp parses input pasm syntax and returns a Lisp program (in output-string-stream p) which
    is a parser (specified by the input pasm code)
  (see READING.txt for commentary)
* usage
  (transpile p <pasm-spec-string> <program-in-dsl-string> '<rule-to-call>)

  (let ((pasm:*pasm-tracing t)) ;; to enable tracing of every rule
    (transpile p <pasm-spec-string> <program-in-dsl-string> '<rule-to-call>))

  ptrace - in <pasm-spec-string> - print a trace of accepted-token and next-token at this point

* operations:
  - 'c' accept a :character token with text 'c' (else error)
  - ?'c' look ahead if succeed if next-token is a :character token with text 'c'
  - KIND all caps -> accept a token of a kind which matches the name in all caps (else error)
  - ?KIND look ahead for token of given kind (no error)
  - KIND/str accept if token is given kind and its text matches the given (lower case) str (else error)
  - ?KIND/str lookahead and succeed if next token has kind given by KIND and text given by str (no error)
  - @<name> - call parsing rule with given name
  - &<pred> - call parsing predicate with name pred, it must return `+ok+` or `+fail+` (predicate can be used in a choice rules - see below)
  - <name>  - call an external mechanism function, return value is ignored
  - {...} - cycle (loop)
  - >     - exit cycle
  - =<name> - define a rule with given name ("rule")
  - -<name> - define a parsing predicate with given name
  - >> ^ok     - return `+ok+` from a parsing predicate
  - >> ^fail   - return `+fail+` from a parsing predicate
  - >>         - return from a parsing rule (return value is not specified and is ignored by caller)
  - [       - begin a choice (if-then-else / COND), first item after '[' must return `+ok+` or `+fail+`
  - |       - choice alternate, first item after '[' must return `+ok+` or `+fail+`
  - ]       - end choice
  - *       - always succeeds (usually used as "otherwise" choice alternate)
  - ~<name> - filter operation - call rule <name> "for every input token", if accepted-token and next-token are
              the same as before the filter operation, accept once (thereby advancing the stream), else
              save "(accepted-token p)" onto a list of new tokens
              ==> i.e. filter the token stream, using a rule that creates one accepted token at a time, throw away
               tokens that were not accepted
  - .  accept any token

  NB - note that all operations begin with a single-character "left-handle" - making it easy to parse this syntax
  NB - >> is overloaded, but can only be one of 3 variants (which remain easy to parse)
  NB - pasm syntax is barely human readable - it is meant as an "assembler" only for creating more-readable DSLs
  NB - inspired by S/SL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S/SL_programming_language (S/SL claims to be a compiler language, but it is much more than that)
* examples
** see READING.txt and test.lisp, test2.lisp and test3.lisp
** 
   PEG-style "a*" is written as `{[ ?SYMBOL/a SYMBOL/a | * > ]}`
   PEG-style "a+" is written as `SYMBOL/a {[ ?SYMBOL/a SYMBOL/a | * > ]}`

   It should be possible to write filters that provide less-unwieldly syntaxes for the above (e.g. A* and a+),
     the filters would produce low-level RPA syntax.

   The point of RPA is to provide access to the most atomic operations (of parsing).  
     Then, write DSL transpilers, composed of the atomic operations to provide more human-readable DSLs
