accept(token-stream,kind,text) --> token-stream
                               -- might cause failure

                     -- kind is an token tag (e.g. defaults: [:CHARACTER | :COMMENT | :SYMBOL |
                                          :STRING | :INTEGER | :SPACE] ; other kinds can
					  be defined and used)
		     text is a string or NIL
		     "accept" advances stream by one token if Kind and (non-NIL) text matches
